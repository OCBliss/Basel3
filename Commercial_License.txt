## B. Commercial Use Restrictions

**Commercial use** of any part of this software, codebase, or its derivatives  
is **not permitted** under the Apache License and requires a separate commercial  
license from the author.

"Commercial use" includes, but is not limited to:

- Use in or by any **regulatory body**, **prudential authority**, **central bank**,  
  or **supervisory agency** for purposes of crafting, testing, enforcing, or embedding  
  compliance rules, capital thresholds, or stress testing frameworks

- Any use that leads to **regulatory mandates, policies, or supervisory guidance**  
  requiring third parties (e.g., banks or financial institutions) to implement  
  this methodology, directly or by implication, regardless of whether the  
  original code is used or re-implemented in derivative form

- Internal use within banks, financial institutions, consultants, or third-party  
  providers for regulatory reporting, capital planning, risk modeling,  
  stress testing, audit, or supervisory data transformation

- Incorporation into **consulting workflows**, commercial analytics products,  
  investment strategies, SaaS platforms, or hosted services that provide  
  Basel III, macroprudential, or compliance-related insights

- Use in training models, financial validation engines, or compliance toolkits  
  that mirror, replicate, or approximate this methodology or its systemic logic  
  without explicit written permission

## C. How to Obtain a Commercial License

To inquire about commercial licensing terms, contact:

**Name:** John W.  
**GitHub:** [https://github.com/OCBLISS](https://github.com/OCBLISS)  
**Email:** johnny.waller.nb@gmail.com

Licensing is required **even if** the implementation is not a literal reuse of this  
code but is **functionally derived from the described methodology, logic, or  
analytical design**. This includes cases where regulatory bodies issue mandates  
that are only materially satisfiable by replicating this framework, or where  
regulated entities are indirectly compelled to approximate it.

**Unauthorized commercial use constitutes a violation of copyright law** and  
may be subject to damages, enforcement actions, and publication of violation.
