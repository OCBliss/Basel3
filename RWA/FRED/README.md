Yields on nominal U.S. Treasury securities with **constant maturity** (**CMT**) are interpolated by the U.S. Treasury from the daily yield curve of non-inflation-indexed Treasury securities. This curve, which relates a bondâ€™s yield to its remaining time to maturity, is based on closing bid yields for actively traded securities in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. These market yields are derived from compilations of price quotations obtained by the **Federal Reserve Bank of New York**.

Constructed constant maturity yields are read from the curve at fixed maturitiesâ€”currently:  
**1, 3, and 6 months**, and **1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years**.  
This method enables the calculation of, for example, a 10-year benchmark rate even if no outstanding security exactly matches that maturity.

Similarly, yields on inflation-indexed securities at **constant maturity** are interpolated from the daily yield curve for **Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)** in the OTC market. These yields are also read at fixed maturities:  
**5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years**.
