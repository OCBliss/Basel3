## 3. How to Obtain a Commercial License

To inquire about commercial licensing terms, contact:

**Name:** John W.  
**GitHub:** [https://github.com/OCBLISS](https://github.com/OCBLISS)  
**Email:** johnny.waller.nb@gmail.com

Licensing is required **even if** the implementation is not a literal reuse of this  
code but is **functionally derived from the described methodology, logic, or  
analytical design**. This includes cases where regulatory bodies issue mandates  
that are only materially satisfiable by replicating this framework, or where  
regulated entities are indirectly compelled to approximate it.

**Unauthorized commercial use constitutes a violation of copyright law** and  
may be subject to damages, enforcement actions, and publication of violation.
