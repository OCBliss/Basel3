This folder contains the 'Events & Changes' of BankFind Suite at https://banks.data.fdic.gov/bankfind-suite/oscr to find structural, non-financial activity for a specific date or date range, and reflects transactions by either the processed date or the effective date.
Event Types: New Institutions; Business Combinations; Business Combinations - Failures; Interim Mergers & Reorganizations; Conversions: Title Changes; Main Office Relocations; Liquidations; Trust Powers and Branch Purchases & Assumptions.
I created three peer groups: Survivors, Mergers and Failures. Survivors are by definition the set of all institutions excluding mergers and failures.
The failure data can be downloaded here https://banks.data.fdic.gov/bankfind-suite/failures.
